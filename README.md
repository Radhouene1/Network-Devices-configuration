# Network-Devices-configuration

Here you find a demo video showing how my python script works. (on LinkedIn)

This script automates the task of configuring any cisco network device. Before you run it, you need tree text files as parameters : 

- "IP_address.txt" contains a list of all the IP addresses of the devices you want to configure.
- "Usernames.txt" contains all possible usernames and passwords to access via SSH. (username;password)
- “Config.txt” contains the configuration that you want to apply to your network devices. 

After execution, it generates a file named "output.txt" that contains the correct username of each IP address, as well as the result of the device configuration.

You will find in the following link the source code in zip format.
